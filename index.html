        <h1>Foundamental problem</h1>
        <p class='intro'>
        The planet is highly exploited and life is increasingly threatened. 
        The socio-economic development of the world without respect for the 
        pillars of sustainable development (social equity, economic efficiency
        and environmental health) creates social and economic inequalities, at 
        all levels of human society. It impacts the earth irreversibly. 
        While this has become at least 5 to 6 times insufficient to meet human 
        needs is deteriorating every day. It is imperative to save the earth and
        life (human, animal and plant)</p>
